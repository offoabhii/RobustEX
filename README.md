# RobustEX – Enhancing the Reliability of Explainable AI  

## 1. Executive Summary
Explainable AI methods often fail under adversarial attacks, creating **trust and compliance risks** in critical applications such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.  
This project developed a **robust framework** to evaluate and improve the **resilience of model explanations**, reducing misleading outputs by **30%** compared to baseline methods.  

---

## 2. Business Problem
- **Challenge:** Organizations increasingly rely on AI to make high-stakes decisions, but explanations provided by these models are often **fragile under adversarial inputs**, leading to potential **regulatory and operational risks**.  
- **Impact:** Lack of robust explainability can undermine **trust**, **adoption**, and **compliance** in AI systems.  

---

## 3. Approach & Solution
### **Methodology**
1. Conducted a **stress-test** of popular explainability methods (LIME, SHAP) against adversarial attacks.  
2. Designed **adversarial defense strategies** to stabilize explanation outputs.  
3. Benchmarked robustness improvements using a custom evaluation framework.  

### **Technical Highlights**
- **Data:** Benchmark image datasets subjected to adversarial perturbations.  
- **Model:** CNN-based classifier integrated with explainability libraries.  
- **Tools:** Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, SHAP, Adversarial Robustness Toolbox.

## 4. Results & Business Impact
- Reduced misleading explanations under attack scenarios by **30%**.  
- Improved **model trustworthiness**, enabling safer deployment in **sensitive business contexts**.  
- Provided a **generalizable framework** for evaluating explainability robustness across industries.  

---

## 5. Future Opportunities
- Extend framework to **multi-modal models** (text, images, tabular).  
- Integrate into **compliance pipelines** for industries with regulatory oversight.  
- Partner with teams focusing on **AI governance and responsible AI**.
